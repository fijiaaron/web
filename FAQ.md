## FAQ

###A. Is this a joke?

No, this isn't a joke. It's just really (kinda?) funny.  And coming soon.

###B. How can I help?

Your assistance is required.  Your cooperation is not expected.

###C. When can I use it?

Read the LICENSE.

###D. What is the license?

Fine, don't read the LICENSE.

###E. How can I use **Web** for testing?

Naturally, being a startup, we're working on a subscription model.  Something Sassy.  I'm pretty sure it will be a mobile app that contains a URL to donate to my paypal account.  And there will be a cool Web 2.0 interface that allows you drag and drop commands and run them in the cloudtubes(TM) and will generate charts guaranteeed to get you a raise when your manager see them.  But of course, that won't be available until we release **Web 2.0**

###F. I meant how can I write tests with Hart?

Check out our sister project [ **Check**  https://github.com/fijiaaron/check ]. It's like a test framework with assertions, but a bit more passive agressive.  And it doesn't mix your tests with your automation.  And it allows you to mix your tests with your automation.  Without mixing them up.

#G. I want to give you money right now.

Give it to OSSO instead http://orphanagesupport.org.  They help orphans.
